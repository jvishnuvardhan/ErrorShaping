## Motivation
  Many neural networks are invented to learn the mapping function from `X` to `Y`. If we express the actual realationship between `X` and `Y` as:

  the learned relationship by neural network, or just any regression, can be expressed as:

## Experiment overview
## Training detail:
               model structure: picture, math
               loss function design: picture, math
               data: visualization, metadata
               result: 3D errors-distr-time for 3 mods
## Plan:
               test on complicated models/tasks.

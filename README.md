## Motivation
  Neural Network is invented to learn the mapping function from `X` to `Y`. This 
## Experiment overview
## Training detail:
               model structure: picture, math
               loss function design: picture, math
               data: visualization, metadata
               result: 3D errors-distr-time for 3 mods
## Plan:
               test on complicated models/tasks.
